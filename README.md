# Sorting with Style
### A tkinter-based Merge Sort Algorithm Visualizer

*This project aims to introduce the merge sort sorting algorithms and how to implement them using tkinter while showcasing a tkinter-based merge sort algorithm visualizer.*

#### Why is Merge Sort Algorithm Important?
We already have a number of sorting algorithms then why do we need this algorithm?
Well One of the main advantages of merge sort is that it has a time complexity of O(n log n), which means it can sort large arrays relatively quickly. It is also a stable sort, which means that the order of elements with equal values is preserved during the sort.Merge sort is a popular choice for sorting large datasets because it is relatively efficient and easy to implement.
